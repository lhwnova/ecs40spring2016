The testhw and the Testing directory are now available for use.
Copy testhw to one of your own directories.
There is no need to copy the Testing directory.
testhw takes only one argument--the directory that holds your airline source code.
testhw will run the style checker, design checker, and operations checker, and
place all of the results in a series of result* files in the directory with the
source code in it.
